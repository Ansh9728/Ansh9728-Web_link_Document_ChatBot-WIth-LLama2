# Ansh9728-Web_link_Document_ChatBot-WIth-LLama2

The project features a sophisticated chatbot powered by a custom dataset and advanced AI technologies. We've integrated the LLama2 model for natural language processing, enabling nuanced conversations. Leveraging Pinecone, a vector database, we store chatbot embeddings for swift data retrieval. Additionally, a transformer model enhances responses, ensuring contextually rich interactions. Our solution prioritizes user-centric experiences, delivering personalized and intelligent responses. This integration of custom data, LLama2, Pinecone, and transformers results in a chatbot that redefines conversational AI, setting new standards for responsiveness and engagement.
